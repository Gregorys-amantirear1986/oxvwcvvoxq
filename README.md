Just got outta the theater after watching Plankton: The Movie. Man, I don’t even know where to start. My mind’s spinning like a hamster on a cheap wheel at this point. I mean, who knew I could have such... opinions about microscopic ocean creatures? The last time I felt this conflicted was when my cat decided that my laptop keyboard was her new litter box.

So this movie, right? It's like someone took a fish documentary and spliced it with a fever dream. You’d think a flick about plankton would be as riveting as watching paint dry, but no! Somehow, this film made me root for these tiny oceanic specks like they were battling Voldemort for the fate of the universe. 

> At one point, I swear I was holding my breath watching a plankton (yeah, never thought I’d say that) navigate some underwater labyrinth that put my Saturday morning maze puzzle to shame. And don’t even get me started on the soundtrack. Like, are we really scoring plankton drama with epic music? What's next, a full symphony for dust bunnies?

It wasn’t all mesmerizing, though. My brain was trying to catch up with the “deep ocean philosophy” they were throwing at us. It's like, dude, I get it, everything's connected, but I’ve already got my hands full just keeping my dog from eating the TV remote! And what was up with that random shrimp character who seemed like he was moonlighting from a Pixar set? Totally stole the show in a movie he wasn’t even supposed to be in.

I’ll admit, there was a moment—just one—where I briefly considered downloading the movie just to see if it was truly this bizarre or if the popcorn butter had gone to my head. 

random = rand() % 42; // Why do I even have this here? Is it related to plankton?

Despite my confusion, though, it somehow wormed (planktoned?) its way into that weird nostalgic part of my brain. I guess it’s like when you find an ugly sweater in your closet; you didn’t even know you had it, but now you kinda love it? So, maybe if you’ve got some random Tuesday night to spare—or you’re just morbidly curious—you might want to watch the movie. Or just tell me about your goldfish; it’d probably make as much sense.
